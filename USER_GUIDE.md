<mark>TODO: Describe the steps where you can get or create the necessary credentials.</mark> 

### Configure the App Name app 

Configurations can be created in Eliona under `Apps > App Name > Settings` which opens the app's [Generic Frontend](https://doc.eliona.io/collection/v/eliona-english/manuals/settings/apps). Here you can use the appropriate endpoint with the POST method. Each configuration requires the following data:

| Attribute         | Description                                                                     |

| `clientSecrets`   | Client secrets obtained from the App Name service.                              |
| `assetFilter`     | Filtering asset during [Continuous Asset Creation](#continuous-asset-creation). |
| `enable`          | Flag to enable or disable this configuration.                                   |
| `refreshInterval` | Interval in seconds for data synchronization.                                   |
| `requestTimeout`  | API query timeout in seconds.                                                   |
| `projectIDs`      | List of Eliona project IDs for data collection.                                 |

Example configuration JSON:

```json
{
  "baseURL": "http://service/v1",
  "clientSecrets": "random-cl13nt-s3cr3t",
  "filter": "",
  "enable": true,
  "refreshInterval": 60,
  "requestTimeout": 120,

## Continuous Asset Creation

Once configured, the app starts Continuous Asset Creation (CAC). Discovered resources are automatically created as assets in Eliona, and users are notified via Eliona’s notification system.
